# Defect Inspection: Deep Learning Approach on TIG welding Aluminum (Pytorch)
**About Project**

This system for classifying good and defect weld using the pretrained model SqueezeNet on the TIG aluminum 5083 dataset and 
it reach a test accuracy equals to 99.5%. There were several experiments, and the models were trained using 6-classes, 4-classes,
and 2-classes tests with highest test accuracies of 71%, 83% and 99.5%, respectively. 
Finally, the 2 models were deployed using Rest API with flask, 
the first one is to detect if the image is good weld or defect and the second one is to classify the defect in 
the image with test accuracy equals to 99%.

## the best accuracy

was the pre-trained model: pytorch squeezenet model with 99.2% test accuracy on TIG Aluminum 5083 dataset.
